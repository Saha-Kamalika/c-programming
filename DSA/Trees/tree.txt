-Depth of x: no of edges in path from root to x
-Height of x: no of edges from x to leaf node
-Height of tree: no of edges from root to a leaf node
-Binary tree: a tree in which a node can have atmost 2 children

-Applications: 
. storing data hierarchically
. organizing data for quick search(BSTs)
. Trie: dictionary
. Network routing algorithm

-strict/proper binary tree: each node have either 2 or 0 children
-complete binary tree: all levels except the last are completely filled and all the nodes are as left as possible
-perfect binary tree: all levels completely filled

# max nodes in a binary tree with height h: 2^(h+1)-1
#min height with n nodes: log2n
#max height with n nodes: n-1

-balanced binary tree: difference between height of left and right subtree for every node is not more than k (mostly 1)

-binary search tree: a binary tree in which all the nodes in the left subtree of a particular node is lesser or equal and the nodes of the right subtree is greater
